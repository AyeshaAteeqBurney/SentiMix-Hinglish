            "CONS: Phrase : family, sentence: there used to be be pros like hybrid working arrangement. they recently scrapped this, forcing everyone to enter office 5 days a week. claiming that they are not forcing people to enter and will allow wfh exception basis but we all know how difficult it will be to get that approved on exception basis. one would probably need to have real medical reasons. to commute everyday 1 -1.5 hours when the same work can be done in the comfort of home does not make any sense. no pros at the moment. cons: 1. hybrid working arrangement scrapped. they force you to enter office 5 days a week and the reason given is coordination is better when at office. this is going back to dinosaur age, and not appreciating that everything can be done online now. zoom calls? team calls? what are those for? why do you think that if a meeting is not done face to face it's not effective? completely backwards thinking. to give staff benefit of wfh for 3 years then scrapping it entirely is completely demotivating. companies should increase benefits to retain staff and lure new ones not scrap benefits. have you thought about us who have to endure commuting 1 hour - 1.5 hours to work, waking up extra early to send kids to daycare? waking up 5am just so we can commute to work? when the same work can be done at home. management preached alot about staff retention when they rolled this hybrid working policy, now where is that?   2. no flexi leave policy they also had previously rolled out flexible leave policy which means there is no cap on leave. but even to take a one week leave, bosses make so much noise like you're asking for the world even though your total leave for the year is only 10- 15 days, still you struggle to get that leave. what's the point of having it on paper and not allowing it to be practiced.  3. they expect you to work while you're on leave. probably the most demotivating factor when you're told to be on standby and check laptop while you're on leave. the whole purpose of leave is to relax and unwind from work but you're being told to work during leave.  4. low salary, low increment. increment is extremely low, how do you retain staff like this  5. no work life balance they hold family day but has no regard for staff family and staff wellbeing. you're told to work til late hours, no regard whether you have a kid or family to attend to. on top of that you're expected to enter office 5 days a week, forcing you to wake up 5am. please be reasonable.\n",

            "PROS: Phrase : network, sentence: made some good friends and network. i will cherish their friendship for lifetime. cons: i worked at deloitte consulting for over a decade, consistently delivering strong performance and generating significant revenue for the firm. despite my contributions, my exit from the company was a disillusioning experience, one that sheds light on the concerning practices within the organization, especially in their handling of employee departures.  after resigning in mid-april, my initial notice period was communicated to conclude in the second week of june, as confirmed via email. however, in a shocking turn of events, i was abruptly informed by the lead talent business advisor from cbo in the last week of may that my last working day would be the very next day. this abrupt decision was clearly a calculated move to prevent me from receiving a well-deserved bonus. when i questioned this decision, the advisor rudely stated that \"employers have the right to decide the last date, and it can be anytime.\" while this may be legally permissible, it is a disgraceful tactic from a company that so publicly champions its values of integrity, ethics, and professionalism.  this was just the beginning of a series of unprofessional and unethical actions 1. delayed relieving letterwhile most companies issue a relieving letter on the last day or within two weeks, deloitte took an astonishing two months to issue one simple letter. even then, it required multiple reminders from my side after they had already completed the final settlement. this delay felt like unnecessary bureaucracy and disrespect toward outgoing employees.  2. corporate card mismanagementon my final day, my corporate card was cancelled without clearing the final due amount. i had to clear the final balance myself to ensure as i started getting emails from card clearance team. it is baffling that deloitte, a firm that prides itself on precision and process and so much gaps in co-ordination among different talent team and couldn’t ensure that payments were settled from their end before cancelling the card.  3. undisclosed final settlement deductionsas if being denied my bonus wasn’t enough, my final settlement included an unexplained deduction of approximately 20,000 inr, with no clear explanation or breakdown provided. despite my repeated requests for clarification, i never received any details. this lack of transparency in financial matters highlights the company's disregard for fair treatment of outgoing employees, which i consider very unfair and deceitful.  it is deeply disappointing that a company that publicly prides itself on values like “giving back to the community” would resort to such tactics to deprive an outgoing employee of their rightful dues. i spent 80% of my time working 12-14 hour days, often sacrificing personal time for the company's success, only to be treated with disrespect in the end.  the one redeeming aspect of my time at deloitte was the lifelong friendships i made with some truly amazing colleagues, but beyond that, the experience has left a bitter taste. the talent business advisors, particularly in cbo, wield unchecked power due to one-sided employment laws, making employees feel powerless in the face of such unfair practices.  to any potential candidates considering deloitte consulting, be prepared. the company may preach ethics, but the very talent team that promotes these values is often the first to violate them. don’t expect the values they boast about to apply to you.\n",

            "CONS: Phrase : manage, sentence: the offices are great, they offer all necessities, clean and spotless the wifi was relatively ok and by the time i was there they were expanding into adding extra things, like game rooms and more, but they were probably just eye candy.  the fact that you could work from home was also a plus to it. when i worked with deloitte i was still pursuing my bachelors degree and they allowed me to come to the office anytime i wanted, so i basically had a fully remote job.  they did have great benefits compared to other companies in my location, including discounts on some of the universities, yearly free health check ups in some of the private medical labs and facilities, but they did come with caveats of sorts, which is fair. cons: the people there are dead on the inside. i don't know if it was just incorrect timing by my side, but everyone in the office did not even take the time to smile or say hello in the hallways. the salary is alright for someone just starting but you have to wait at least 1 year to even be considered for a raise which in my experience doesn't really happen that often.  meanwhile management always tried to protect themselves when things did not go as expected. for example i had just started, it was my 5th or 6th month there. all servicenow developers had to take an online certification before starting work. my boss knew that i was in university at the time and told me to not worry, take everything slow the possibility to take the exam will still be there. i still gave him a timeframe in which i was considering taking the exam and we both agreed that that was more than ok.  one week later i find out that in a partner meeting or whatever they refer to it as, i'm not very familiar with corporate lingo, my boss just completely threw me under the bus and used my full name telling the partners that this developer is lacking behind for no reason, just so he would appear as the competent one in front of the partners. i quit a few months after that, because who knows what he could've said about me or any other coworkers.  lastly i know deloitte is a big name to have on your cv (at least in my country), but if you are just starting out in a junior role, trust me it's not really worth it. you will have to spend years of your life just for you to not be considered a junior anymore. i have noticed that all of upper management was an outside hire and never someone promoted from within, so if that truly is what you want to do i would not recommend it whatsoever, you are just throwing away valuable time, which could have been spent in a company that treats more than just a number.\n",
